# ios7PirateAdventure

The Pirate Adventure Game is now complete.
The player navigates around the map interacting with what he finds on each tile.
Eventually, the player finds the Pirate Boss - and fights him.

Enhancement ideas:

Randomize the tiles - so the player doesn't always go LEFT-RIGHT-UP for example.

Randomize the starting health of the pirate

Do not allow the player to leave the Boss Pirate tile

Only enable the Action button for one usage per tile.
